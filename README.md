# al-yo-bo

**al-yo-bo** is a single-user bookmark manager: capture links, organize them, search them, and chat
about them.

- Organize bookmarks into categories, each containing many tags.
- Search by tag, description, title, URL, category, and scraped page content.
- Browse as a list or a grid.
- Chat with an AI assistant to search and get suggestions, without losing your place in the UI.
- Import bookmarks from markdown collection files.

> **Status:** docs-first scaffold. The architecture, data model, and design are decided; application
> code is not written yet.
